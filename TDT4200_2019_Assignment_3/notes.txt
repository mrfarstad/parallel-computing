    Is it necessary to create a type for pixel? We just want to spread the
    pointers to the pixels, and the pointer have a specified type.

    Answer:
    NEVER pass a pointer's contents to another process in MPI

    MPI processes cannot read each others' memory, and virtual addressing
    makes one process' pointer completely meaningless to another.
